# ðŸ§ Graph Coding Tasks â€“ Notebook Overview

This repository contains Python implementations for various fundamental graph theory tasks. The code is well-commented and structured for educational use, making it ideal for students learning graph algorithms and representations.

 ##  Tasks Covered
 1. Degree of Each Vertex
- Compute the degree of every vertex in a graph.
- Store the result in a dictionary and sort vertices based on their degree values.

 2. Graph Representation Conversion
- Inter-convert between:
  - Adjacency Matrix
  - Adjacency List
  - Edge List

 3. Adjacency Check
- Given a graph and two vertices, check if they are adjacent (i.e., directly connected).

 4. Completeness Check
- Check whether a given graph is complete, meaning every pair of distinct vertices is connected.

 5. Connectivity Check
- Determine if the graph is connected, i.e., there's a path between every pair of vertices.

 6. Walk, Trail, or Path Validator
- Given a list of vertices, check if the sequence represents:
  - A **Walk** (repeated vertices/edges allowed)
  - A **Trail** (no repeated edges)
  - A **Path** (no repeated vertices or edges)
  - Or **None**

 7. Tree Check
- Verify whether a given graph qualifies as a tree (connected and acyclic).

 8. Spanning Tree of a Cyclic Graph
- From a connected cyclic graph, construct a **spanning tree**.

 9. Leaf Node Counter
- Count the number of **leaf nodes** in a tree (nodes with degree 1).

 10. Binary Tree Check
- Determine whether a given tree is a **binary tree** (each node has at most two children).

 11. Height of a Node
- Given a tree and a specific node, compute its **height** (longest path to a leaf node).

 12. Depth of a Node
- Calculate the **depth** of a given node (distance from the root to that node).
